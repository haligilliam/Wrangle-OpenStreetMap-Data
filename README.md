# Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data

This repository was created for my project submission for the Open Street Map (OSM) project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. 

These are the following files: 
* README.md: This file that contains all the files used. 
* projectfile.md: The final project containing answers to the rubric questions.
* StreetNameAuditandCleanup: The script used in auditing and cleaning the street names. 
* ZipCodeAuditandCleaup: The script used in auditing and cleaning the zip codes. 
* data.py: The script that parses, cleans, and outputs the data as CSV.
* schema.py: The schema used for SQL database.
* dataosmfile: Links to zip folder with OSM file and OSM sample file used for map area.

I used the following sources through the course on the project: 
* Case Study on the Udacity Data Wrangling course
* https://sites.google.com/a/wgu.edu/c750---data-wrangling/extracts for my SeaTac data extract
